            <h3>Hi, I'm Kailie</h3>
            <h3>I'm a UX Designer studying Front-End Development.</h3>
                <p>I graduated in 2018 with an Aboriginal Visual Arts Diploma in Porcupine Quillwork from the New Brunswick College of Craft and Design. 
                    I spent 3 years at the college developing skills in drawing, colour theory, ​the creative process, art history, and design.
                    <br>
                    Since then I’ve worked as a product designer in an engraving shop, where I worked with clients from concept to completion, designing, engraving, and testing products. 
                    I also worked in family services, working with Indigenous clients to create an environment for them to thrive. 
                    When I began learning UX design and code, it felt like the different paths I had been on had come together in beautiful harmony!
                    <br>
                    In my own time I volunteer with Cystic Fibrosis Canada planning and executing events, pre-COVID I was a clinic instructor at the Running Room to encourage long lasting health and fitness goals.
                    I completed my first marathon in May 2020 with a group of 6, one being my dad! 
                    When not on the running track, you can catch me on the race track dodging pylons... ok hitting pylons.
